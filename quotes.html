Some by contrast, are born weak of body or mind, or with few, if any, talents. All men are different. Yes, the very existence of man is discriminatory! That's why there is war, violence and unrest. Inequality is not evil. Equality is! What became of James Ruse, who claimed that all are equal? It is in constant conflict because its tenets go against human nature! The Sydney Boys and Sydney Girls, which harbour similar sentiments, are constantly mired with sloths! But our Sydney Grammar is not like them! We put an end to wars and evolve with every conquest! Sydney Grammar alone looks forward and moves forward to a better future! Fight! For the future rests in the hands of its ruler! Floreat Grammatica!"</i>
