                <div class = "Courseinfo"> Mark achieved: SY <br> Comments: The COVID adjusted SY/FL system caused the course to lose a lot of the tension spurred by the desire to get very high marks. Otherwise, I found the course content very good, though the delivery was somewhat mediocre.</div>
                <div class = "CourseHeader"> <h2> SENG2021: Requirements and Design Workshop </h2></div>
                <div class = "Courseinfo"> Mark achieved: <br> Comments: A much better group project experience than ENGG1000 as we were allowed to form our own groups. Overall, the project we produced was a bit too ambitious and the course took a lot of work. After finishing the project, however, I feel somewhat satisfied. <br>
                                            We were shortlisted for the Macquarie Software Engineering prize for this project.</div>
                <div class = "CourseHeader"> <h2> FINS1613: Business Finance </h2></div>
                <div class = "Courseinfo"> Mark achieved: <br> Comments: Pretty fundamental finance course with good content. I did very well up to the final exam (95+), but dramatically underprepared for the final since the online format took the pre-exam tension away from me. I have a lot of regrets from not preparing for the final enough for this course, considering it wasn't difficult, and I could've done very well.</div>

                <div class = "Courseinfo"> Mark achieved: 83<br> Comments: I got almost full marks (95+) in all of the coding components, and did badly in the theory section in the final exam, but I can't find out why since I sat the supplementary so I can't review my exam.</div>
                <div class = "CourseHeader"> <h2> ENGG1000: Introduction to Engineering Design and Innovation </h2></div>
                <div class = "Courseinfo"> Mark achieved: 79<br> Comments: The high weighting of marks toward documentation and group presentations in a randomly assigned group takes marks away from actual engineering design and innovation, making the course difficult to work with in many scenarios. <br> 
                                        In my case, a group member dropped out and wasn't replaced, and it made the course harder. This is my least favorite course so far.</div>
