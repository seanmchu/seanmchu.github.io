                    I am a software engineering and commerce student at UNSW, due to graduate at the end of 2023 with a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of 85.833. <br>
                    I'm also currently a member of the Australian Junior National Team for Fencing, where I represent the country in various international events. <br>
                    Outside of my academic and sporting commitments, I work as a PASS Economics tutor for the UNSW business school and as a Fencing coach at Sydney Boys High School.<br>
                    I also participate in campus life through my role as events director in the UNSW Mahjong society, where I manage a team to organise recreational events on and off campus.<br>
                    My technical skills include: C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, LaTeX, and Microsoft Office.<br>
                    Outside of these commitments, my hobbies include competitive programming, reading, going to the gym, and playing video games. <br>
